Welcome to the repository accompanying the conference paper:

    \C\. Linssen and P. Harpe, "Practical Measurement of Voltage-Controlled Current Source Output Impedance for Applications in Transcranial Electrical Stimulation," 2021 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS), 6–9 Oct 2021, pp. 1–6, doi: `10.1109/BioCAS49922.2021.9644974 <https://doi.org/10.1109/BioCAS49922.2021.9644974>`_.

For BibTeX and other citation formats, please visit https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9644974.

This repository contains the simulations, analysis and plotting scripts, prototype PCB designs and empirical measurement data for reproducing the figures in the paper.

The final paper can be downloaded from https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9644974. The IEEE policy permits (`IEEE Publication Services and Products Board Operations Manual 2021, Section 8.1.9 <https://pspb.ieee.org/images/files/files/opsmanual.pdf>`_) authors to disseminate 'preprint' versions of their papers. This 'author preprint version' can be found under `paper/ <paper>`_ and corresponds to the peer-reviewed manuscript submitted as the final version to the conference.

The unabridged preprint, which was *not peer reviewed*, contains additional background information such a loop stability simulations, that could be helpful in reproducing and iterating upon the results in the paper. This unabridged version can be found under the directory `preprint/ <preprint>`_.

We (the authors of the paper) welcome feedback; please write to the corresponding author at c.linssen@donders.ru.nl.
